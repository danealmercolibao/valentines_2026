				<p>My Luvvyyyy,</p>

				<p>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</p>

				<p>Before anything else, I want to say this sincerely — I’m sorry.</p>

				<p>
					I’m sorry if these past few days I didn’t give you the attention you needed. I know you’ve
					been busy with school, especially being the new SSG President and handling so many
					responsibilities for the Valentine’s event yesterday. I see how hard you work. I see the
					pressure you carry. And I know that during times like this, you don’t just need a boyfriend
					— you need support, reassurance, and someone who gives you comfort.
				</p>

				<p>
					Instead of adding to your peace, I may have made you feel like I wasn’t present enough.
					And for that, I’m truly sorry.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reason I seemed busy was because I was preparing these flowers for you. I wanted to
					give you something made with effort and intention — something that shows you how much
					you mean to me. Every petal I arranged, I was thinking about how proud I am of you. How
					strong you are. How capable you are.
				</p>

				<div class="letter-images">
					<img class="letter-image" src="flower1.jpg" alt="Flower image 1" />
					<img class="letter-image" src="flower2.jpg" alt="Flower image 2" />
				</div>

				<p>
					I’m giving you 15 flowers with kitkats your favvv chocolate because each one represents a reason why I love and appreciate
					you — your leadership, your dedication, your kindness, your patience, your strength, your
					intelligence, your compassion, your confidence, your loyalty, your beautiful smile, your
					hardworking heart, your warmth, your honesty, your resilience, and most importantly, you.
                    but also because a 15-flower bouquet traditionally symbolizes a deep and sincere apology. 
                    It’s a way of saying, “I’m truly sorry” and “please forgive me.”

                <p>
                    So these flowers carry two meanings:
                    My appreciation for who you are… and my heartfelt apology if I made you feel less loved.
                </p>
				</p>

				<p>
					And I chose light blue because it symbolizes peace, trust, loyalty, and reassurance. I know
					your days are busy and sometimes overwhelming. I want these flowers to remind you to
					breathe. To stay calm. To remember that someone is here for you. Light blue represents the
					kind of love I want to give you — steady, calm, and safe. A love that doesn’t add pressure,
					but removes it.
				</p>

				<p>
					I’m so proud of you as a leader. But beyond that, I care about you as a person. When things
					get stressful, I want to be your rest, not another responsibility.
				</p>

				<p>
					I’m sorry if I lacked attention these past few days. I promise to do better, especially when
					you need me most.
				</p>

				<p>I love you so much my BB. 💙🌸</p>
